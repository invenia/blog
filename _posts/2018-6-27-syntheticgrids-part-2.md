In the [first part]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-6-27-syntheticgrids-part-1 %}), we discussed the motivation and model behind SyntheticGrids.jl. In this post we show how to use it.

To use SyntheticGrids.jl, [Julia 0.6.1 or newer](https://julialang.org/downloads/) is required. Once Julia is properly installed, the package can be installed via

```julia
julia> Pkg.add("SyntheticGrids")
```

This should take care of all dependencies. In order to check if the package has been properly installed, use

```julia
julia> Pkg.test("SyntheticGrids")
```

### A (very) simple test example

As an introduction to the package, we start by automatically generating a small, but complete grid.

```julia
julia> using SyntheticGrids

julia> grid = Grid(false);
```

This command generates a complete grid corresponding to the region contained in the box defined by latitude [33, 35] and longitude [-95, -93] (default values). It automatically places loads and generators and builds the transmission line network (we will soon see how to do each of these steps manually). Here, `false` determines that substations will not be created. Note the addition of the semicolon, `;`, at the end of the command. This has just cosmetic effect in suppressing the printing of the resulting object in the REPL. Even a small grid object corresponds to a reasonably large amount of data.

A `Grid` object has several attributes that can be inspected. First, let's look at the buses:

```julia
julia> length(buses(grid))
137

julia> buses(grid)[1]
LoadBus(
	id=1,
	coords=LatLon(lat=33.71503°, lon=-93.166445°),
	load=0.17400000000000002
	voltage=200,
	population=87,
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
)

julia> buses(grid)[end]
GenBus(
	id=137
	coords=LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°),
	generation=56.0
	voltage=Real[115.0],
	tech_type=AbstractString["Conventional Hydroelectric"],
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
	pfactor=0.9
	summgen=61.8
	wintgen=62.0
	gens=SyntheticGrids.Generator[SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 28.0, 0.9, 15.0, 30.9, 31.0, "1H", "OP"), SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 28.0, 0.9, 15.0, 30.9, 31.0, "1H", "OP")]
)
```

We see that our grid has a total of 137 buses (see Figure 2 for a visualisation of the result). The first is a load bus (`LoadBus`). The values of the attributes `connected_to` and `connections` are not explicitly printed. However, the printing of `(...)` indicates that those sets have been populated (otherwise, they would be printed as `()`).

![Synthetic grids]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/Grids.png)
_Visualisation of two grids generated using the procedure described here. Notice that both present the same bus locations, as their placement is entirely deterministic. The transmission line topology however is different in each case, as it is generated through an stochastic process. Note that the generated grids are non-planar._

The last bus of the list corresponds to a generator (`GenBus`). One important thing to notice here is that it contains an attribute called `gens`, which is an array of `Generator`-type objects. `GenBus`es represent power plants, which may (or may not, as is the case here) contain several different generating units. These individual generating units are stored within the `gens` attribute.

We can also inspect the transmission lines:

```julia
julia> length(trans_lines(grid))
167

julia> trans_lines(grid)[1]
TransLine(
	connecting: (LoadBus(
	id=3,
	coords=LatLon(lat=33.889332°, lon=-93.097793°),
	load=8.18
	voltage=100,
	population=4090,
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
), LoadBus(
	id=1,
	coords=LatLon(lat=33.71503°, lon=-93.166445°),
	load=0.17400000000000002
	voltage=200,
	population=87,
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
)),
	impedance=0.9175166312451004,
	capacity=1400
)
```

There are 167 transmission lines in our grid. By looking at the first one, we see that they are defined by a tuple of `Bus`-type objects (here both are `LoadBus`es), by an impedance value (here taken as `Real`, since the package has been developed with DC OPF in mind), and a current carrying capacity value.

The adjacency matrix of the system can also be easily accessed:

```julia
julia> adjacency(grid)
137×137 SparseMatrixCSC{Bool,Int64} with 334 stored entries:
  [3  ,   1]  =  true
  [6  ,   1]  =  true
  [15 ,   1]  =  true
  [34 ,   1]  =  true
  [35 ,   1]  =  true
  [4  ,   2]  =  true
  ⋮
  [54 , 135]  =  true
  [58 , 135]  =  true
  [67 , 135]  =  true
  [73 , 136]  =  true
  [42 , 137]  =  true
  [46 , 137]  =  true
```

Notice that we use a sparse matrix representation for better efficiency.

Substations can also be inspected, but we did not create any, so the result should be empty:

```julia
julia> substations(grid)
0-element Array{SyntheticGrids.Substation,1}
```

That can be remedied by changing the boolean value when creating the grid:

```julia
julia> grid = Grid(true);

julia> length(substations(grid))
43

julia> substations(grid)[end]
Substation(
	id=43
	coords=LatLon(lat=34.412130070351765°, lon=-93.11856562311557°),
	voltages=Real[115.0],
	load=0,
	generation=199.0,
	population=0,
	connected_to=Set{Substation}(...)
	grouping=SyntheticGrids.Bus[GenBus(
	id=137
	coords=LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°),
	generation=56.0
	voltage=Real[115.0],
	tech_type=AbstractString["Conventional Hydroelectric"],
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
	pfactor=0.9
	summgen=61.8
	wintgen=62.0
	gens=SyntheticGrids.Generator[SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 28.0, 0.9, 15.0, 30.9, 31.0, "1H", "OP"), SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.4425°, lon=-93.0262°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 28.0, 0.9, 15.0, 30.9, 31.0, "1H", "OP")]
), GenBus(
	id=135
	coords=LatLon(lat=34.570984°, lon=-93.194425°),
	generation=75.0
	voltage=Real[115.0],
	tech_type=AbstractString["Conventional Hydroelectric"],
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
	pfactor=0.9
	summgen=75.0
	wintgen=75.0
	gens=SyntheticGrids.Generator[SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.570984°, lon=-93.194425°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 37.5, 0.9, 20.0, 37.5, 37.5, "10M", "OP"), SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.570984°, lon=-93.194425°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 37.5, 0.9, 20.0, 37.5, 37.5, "10M", "OP")]
), GenBus(
	id=136
	coords=LatLon(lat=34.211913°, lon=-93.110963°),
	generation=68.0
	voltage=Real[115.0],
	tech_type=AbstractString["Hydroelectric Pumped Storage", "Conventional Hydroelectric"],
	connected_to=Set{Bus}(...)
	connections=Set{TransLine}(...)
	pfactor=0.95
	summgen=68.0
	wintgen=68.0
	gens=SyntheticGrids.Generator[SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.211913°, lon=-93.110963°), Real[115.0], "Conventional Hydroelectric", 40.0, 0.95, 15.0, 40.0, 40.0, "1H", "OP"), SyntheticGrids.Generator(LatLon(lat=34.211913°, lon=-93.110963°), Real[115.0], "Hydroelectric Pumped Storage", 28.0, 0.95, 15.0, 28.0, 28.0, "1H", "OP")]
)]
)
```

By changing the boolean value to `true` we now create substations (with default values; more into that later) and can inspect them.

### A more complete workflow

Let's now build a grid step by step. First, we start by generating an empty grid:

```julia
julia> using SyntheticGrids

julia> grid = Grid()
SyntheticGrids.Grid(2872812514497267479, SyntheticGrids.Bus[], SyntheticGrids.TransLine[], SyntheticGrids.Substation[], Array{Bool}(0,0), Array{Int64}(0,0))
```

Notice that one of the attributes has been automatically initialised. That corresponds to the `seed` which will be used for all stochastic steps. Control over the seed value gives us control over reproducibility. Conversely, that value could have been specified via `grid = Grid(seed)`.

Now let's place the load buses. We could do this by specifying latitude and longitude limits (e.g.: `place_loads_from_zips!(grid; latlim = (30, 35), longlim = (-99, -90))`), but let's look at a more general way of doing this. We can define any function that receives a tuple containing a latitude--longitude pair and returns `true` if within the desired region and `false` otherwise:

```julia
julia> my_region(x::Tuple{Float64, Float64}, r::Float64) = ((x[1] - 33)^2 + (x[2] + 95)^2 < r^2)
my_region (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(x) = my_region(x, 5.)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> place_loads_from_zips!(grid, f)

julia> length(buses(grid))
3287
```

Here, `my_region` defines a circle (in latitude-longitude space) of radius `r` around the point (33, -95). Any zip code within that region is added to the grid (to a total of 3287) as a load bus. The same can be done for the generators:

```julia
julia> place_gens_from_data!(grid, f)

julia> length(buses(grid))
3729
```

This command adds all generators within the same region, bringing the total amount of buses to 3729.

We can also manually add extra load or generation buses if we wish:

```julia
julia> a_bus = LoadBus((22., -95.), 12., 200, 12345)
LoadBus(
	id=-1,
	coords=LatLon(lat=22.0°, lon=-95.0°),
	load=12.0
	voltage=200,
	population=12345,
	connected_to=Set{Bus}()
	connections=Set{Transline}()
)

julia> SyntheticGrids.add_bus!(grid, a_bus)

julia> length(buses(grid))
3730
```

The same works for `GenBus`es.

Once all buses are in place, it is time to connect them with transmission lines. This can be done via a single function (this step can take some time for larger grids):

```julia
julia> connect!(grid)

julia> length(trans_lines(grid))
0
```

This function goes through the stochastic process of creating the system's adjacency matrix, but it does not create the actual `TransLine` objects (hence the zero length). That is done via the `create_lines!` function. Also note that `connect!` has several parameters for which we adopted default values. For a description of those, see `? connect`.

Before we create the lines, it is interesting to revisit adding new buses. Now that we have created the adjacency matrix for the network, we have two options when adding a new bus: either we redo the `connect!` step in order to incorporate the new bus in the grid, or we simply extend the adjacency matrix to include the new bus (which won't have any connections). This is controlled by the `reconnect` keyword argument that can be passed to `add_bus!`. In the former case, one uses `reconnect = false` (the default option); connections can always be manually added by editing the adjacency matrix (and the `connected_to` fields of the involved buses).

Once the adjacency matrix is ready, `TransLine` objects are created by invoking the `create_lines!` function:

```julia
julia> SyntheticGrids.create_lines!(grid)

julia> length(trans_lines(grid))
4551
```

We have generated the connection topology with transmission line objects. Finally, we may want to coarse-grain the grid. This is done via the `cluster!` function, which receives as arguments the number of each type of cluster: load, both load and generation or pure generation. This step may also take a little while for large grids.

```julia
julia> length(substations(grid))
0

julia> cluster!(grid, 1500, 20, 200)

julia> length(substations(grid))
1700
```

At this point, the whole grid has been generated. If you wish to save it, the functions `save` and `load_grid` are available. Please note that the floating-point representation of numbers may lead to infinitesimal changes to the values when saving and reloading a grid. Besides precision issues, they should be equivalent.

```julia
julia> save(grid, "./test_grid.json")

julia> grid2 = load_grid("./test_grid.json")
```

Some simple statistics can be computed over the grid, such as the average node degree and the clustering coefficient:

```julia
julia> mean_node_deg(adjacency(grid))
2.4402144772117964

julia> cluster_coeff(adjacency(grid))
0.08598360707539486
```

The generated grid can easily be exported to pandapower in order to carry out powerflow studies. The option to export to PowerModels.jl should be added soon.

```julia
julia> pgrid = to_pandapower(grid)
PyObject This pandapower network includes the following parameter tables:
   - load (3288 elements)
   - trafo (913 elements)
   - ext_grid (1 elements)
   - bus_geodata (3730 elements)
   - bus (3730 elements)
   - line (3638 elements)
   - gen (1397 elements)
```

Conclusion
----------

Hopefully, this post helped as a first introduction to the SyntheticGrids.jl package. There are more functions which have not been mentioned here; the interested reader should refer to the full [documentation](https://invenia.github.io/SyntheticGrids.jl/stable/) for a complete list of methods. This is an ongoing project, and, as such, several changes and additions might still happen. The most up-to-date version can always be found at [Github](https://github.com/invenia/SyntheticGrids.jl).
