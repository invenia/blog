Welcome to the Invenia blog!

Our day to day work at Invenia is focused on improving the efficiency of electricity grids---large and complex systems, where failures can cause significant financial and human losses, and improper operation can to lead to large environmental costs as well. Improvements in planning and other operations can directly decrease the environmental impact of energy generation and increase the reliability of the entire system.

Our larger mission is to use use machine learning along with modern software and computing tools to tackle important and difficult problems. Due to the nature of this work, we get to explore many areas of software development, modern programming languages (such as Julia), distributed computing, all aspects of the energy system, machine learning, and interesting data.

The goals of this blog are to share some of our work, to discuss the above topics more generally (in a clear and pedagogical way), and to start interesting conversations. We hope you enjoy it and we look forward to receiving feedback.
